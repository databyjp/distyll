This segment is then encapsulated with header information from the network layer and sent to the receiving host through routers, bridges, switches, etc.\\n\\nThe need for an additional layer between the application and network layer is addressed, with the network layer offering a best-effort delivery service model. The transport layer comes into play by providing functionalities such as guaranteed delivery of packets and data integrity, which the network layer does not guarantee.
