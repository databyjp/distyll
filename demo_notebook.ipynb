And one big sort of potential for improvement that we have is cost reduction, because something that if you have a multi-tenancy case, most likely not all of your tenants are active at the same time. If they are, all your tenants would need to sort of be active and this is, I'm using this fuzzy term of active versus inactive because that's just as an abstraction, we can go into what that means as well.

Yeah, yeah, what it is and sort of why you need it even in the first place. So multi-tenancy for us, and I always feel like I need to sort of, because when people hear multi-tenancy, they think of cloud operations or shared resource and cloud operations. And of course we have a cloud service. So multi-tenancy for us is not about how we run the Weeviate cloud service. Yes, you can use multi-tenancy on the cloud service, but it's actually about multi-tenancy for you, the user. So let's say you have an application, your application has separate users and they have somehow data that needs to be separated from one way or another. So for example, let's say you build an\",\n  'chunk_number': 2,\n  'source_path': 'https://youtu.be/xk28RMhRy1U',\n  'source_title': 'Etienne Dilocker on Weaviate 1.20 - Weaviate Podcast #56!'},\n {'_additional': {'distance': 0.18398982},\n  'body': \"old setup, this shard with this specific configuration would live on one of those exactly three nodes. So one way of distributing this around the setup a bit would be if you have 30 tenants, or sorry, in the old set of 30 classes, I mean, you would have 30 tenants, but you would model them with 30 classes. Each node could hold 10 of those basically. And then that would sort of be evenly distributed, but you'd have very little control. Now with multi-tenancy, we keep that idea of having one shard, but the shards have become much more lightweight. So you have essentially, we've run a couple of load tests, and we could, in one example, this depends a bit on sort of\",\n  'chunk_number': 16,\n  'source_path': 'https://youtu.be/xk28RMhRy1U',\n  'source_title': 'Etienne Dilocker on Weaviate 1.20 - Weaviate Podcast #56!'},\n {'_additional': {'distance': 0.18992794},\n  'body': \"worked because by creating 10 classes, you also under the hood created 10 shards. It was kind of doing a lot of overhead for essentially you just wanted to end up with 10 shards. You could kind of do it with creating 10 classes. The multi-tenancy feature, the native multi-tenancy feature, in the simplest terms you can think of it, it's a single class, but within that class, we create one shard per tenant. So shards are now no longer this static thing, but they're completely dynamic. Like you can add them on the fly, you can delete them on the fly. And the kind of cluster association with a shard, still holds true.

So of course, as a user, you don't know where that stuff is scheduled, but VV8 will just say like with every, and this is the only real API change for multi-tenancy is that now you have to specify your tenant key.

Absolutely. This is definitely not a selfish question. I think our viewers and listeners will absolutely appreciate that as well. So this class-based workaround kind of worked because one thing that a class already does is it creates something like some separate space somewhere basically in the class and internally in Weave V8, this is a shard.
