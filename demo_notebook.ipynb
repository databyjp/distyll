It provides service discovery and load balancing, storage orchestration, automated rollouts and rollbacks, automatic bin packing, self-healing, secret and configuration management. Kubernetes aims to support a diverse variety of workloads and does not limit the types of applications supported. It is not a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS system and does not provide application-level services or deployment of source code. Kubernetes eliminates the need for orchestration and provides a set of independent, composable control processes. It is highly portable and can run on various platforms. Kubernetes combines Google's experience with best practices from the community. It evolved from the traditional deployment era to the container deployment era, providing benefits such as agility, scalability, and cost reduction.\""
