It approximates distance calculations by computing values offline using algorithms like singular value decomposition. The trade-off is that it requires additional memory but provides faster vector search. It is particularly beneficial for higher dimensional vectors. The technique involves projecting the query and neighboring nodes onto a center node to approximate distances. HNSW-FINGER has been evaluated and shown to provide significant speed-ups, especially for higher dimensional vectors. It can also be used in disk-based solutions to reduce memory overhead.'"
