It aims to support a diverse variety of workloads, including stateless, stateful, and data-processing workloads. Kubernetes does not limit the types of applications supported and does not deploy source code or build applications. It provides service discovery and load balancing, storage orchestration, automated rollouts and rollbacks, automatic bin packing, self-healing, and secret and configuration management. Kubernetes is not a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS system and does not provide application-level services or dictate logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions. It also does not provide or mandate a configuration language/system or comprehensive machine configuration, maintenance, management, or self-healing systems. Kubernetes eliminates the need for orchestration and combines Google's experience with best practices from the community. It is used for managing containers in a production environment and provides benefits such as agility, scalability, and resource utilization.\""
