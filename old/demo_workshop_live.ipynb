Both focused on the \\\"Large-scale pretrained models\\\", citing as an example of LLMs the BERT family, starting at 110M parameters and referring to models in the 340M parameters range as \\\"very large LMs\\\".\\nPerhaps surprisingly, both cite the pre-transformer RNN-based ELMo - the 2018 architecture that inspired BERT - as the first LLM, given the number of parameters (94M), as well as the size of the pretraining dataset (>1B tokens). Despite the comparable parameter size, the original Transformer is generally not considered as an LLM due to a smaller pretraining dataset (generally estimated in the 100M tokens range).\\nOverall, due to a smooth scaling in LLM model performance from  ~100M parameters to 500B+ parameters and progressive unlocking of emergent capabilities such as multi-lingual translation, arithmetic, or programming code composition, all post-ELMo models are referred to by researchers as LLMs.\",\n",
